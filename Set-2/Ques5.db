Design an Entity-Relationship schema for a database of events. The database should contain
the information about:
● Users - A user will have name, email, and phone no.
● Event - An event will have title, start-date, end date and status which can be - Pending,
In-progress, Completed and Canceled
The Information that must be captured in the database is related to following functionalities -
1 - A user can create an event, and edit it
2 - A user can invite other users to his events, and these guests can either accept or Reject that
invitation
3- For events that span across multiple days, a guest may be invited for the whole event , or for
individual days only
As part of the solution, either create an Entity Relationship schema, or create a relational
database schema that covers the above requirements.




CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Events (
    EventID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    StartDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
    EndDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
    Status ENUM('Pending', 'In-progress', 'Completed', 'Canceled') NOT NULL,
    CreatorUserID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CreatorUserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

CREATE TABLE Invitations (
    InvitationID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EventID INT,
    InviterUserID INT,
    InviteeUserID INT,
    InvitationStatus ENUM('Accept', 'Reject', 'Pending') NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (EventID) REFERENCES Events(EventID),
    FOREIGN KEY (InviterUserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    FOREIGN KEY (InviteeUserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

CREATE TABLE EventDays (
    EventDayID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EventID INT,
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (EventID) REFERENCES Events(EventID)
);
